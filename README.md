  <h2>Description</h2>
  
  The Readme Generator is a CLI application that utilizes the Inquirer package to recieve user prompts and then generate a markdown file. The markdown file can be a basic file and only include the project name, project descritpion, and the creator's Github info. Alternatively, the markdown file can include optional sections such as: installation, usage, license, contribution, and tests. 

  <h2>Table of Contents</h2>

    <li><a href="#usage">Usage</a></li>
    <li><a href="#license">License</a></li>
    <li><a href="#contribution">Contribution</a></li>
    
  <li><a href="#questions">Questions</a></li>
 </ul>

  <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Install node.js for your operating system. </li> 
    <li>Ensure that the 'node' command can be ran in the terminal by fixing the PATH if you are on Windows. </li> 
    <li>Clone or download the contents of this project's repo onto your local machine.</li> 
    <li>Navigate to the copied files through the terminal.</li> 
    <li>Run 'npm -init' in the terminal to download the required dependencies.</li>

  <h2>End Note - Thank you to the Reader</h2>

  Thank you for taking the time to visit my application and read through the README! This readme (aside from this section, which I can hopefully add on to the application!) was actually generated using the Readme Generator application! This project introduced a TON of convienant Javascript ES6 features and helped me get a better handle on how async functions work in node. Additionally, I learned that HTML can be used in readmes for github?! This has made it so much easier to include gifs in these! Please enjoy the fun fact and gif from my random collection of things that make me laugh!

  **Fun Fact:** The longest word consits of 189,819 letters! It is the full name of 'titin' which is a giant protein. Don't believe me? Maybe you believe Wikipedia! I know I sure do, here's the link: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English</a><br />
